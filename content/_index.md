# Container Registry Management with ECR and Security Policies

#### Overview

In this workshop, you will implement a **comprehensive container registry management** system using **Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**. The content focuses on designing a secure, efficient, and professional container management workflow, fully integrated with:

- **Security policies (IAM)**  
- **Vulnerability scanning (Amazon Inspector)**  
- **Granular access control**  
- **Lifecycle automation and CI/CD deployment**  
- **Monitoring and alerting (CloudWatch & SNS)**  
- **Compliance validation and cost optimization**

You will learn to design the system following a DevSecOps approach, where container images are scanned before deployment, access is tightly controlled, and old resources are automatically cleaned up to reduce cost.

---

## By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

- Apply **security policies** using IAM, demonstrating how ECR interacts with services like CodeBuild, ECS, and Lambda  
- Integrate **Amazon Inspector** to automatically scan container images for vulnerabilities upon image push  
- Implement **granular access controls**, ensuring users and services only have the permissions they need  
- Configure **ECR lifecycle policies** to automatically clean up unused or untagged images and optimize storage cost  
- Design an **automated CI/CD pipeline** that triggers security scans when new images are pushed  
- Set up **monitoring and alerts** to notify you of potential security threats or suspicious activities  
- Build a **production-ready DevSecOps pipeline** for managing containers securely and efficiently on AWS

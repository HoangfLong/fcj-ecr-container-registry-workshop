In this section, we will set up the necessary access permissions by configuring AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). This is a foundational step to ensure that users and AWS services can securely interact with Amazon ECR and related resources, adhering to the principle of "least privilege."

#### Objectives of this section

* Understand the role of IAM in controlling access to ECR.
* Set up the required IAM Users, IAM Policies, and IAM Roles for the workshop's operations.
* Ensure automated processes (like GitHub Actions) can authenticate and interact with AWS securely.
